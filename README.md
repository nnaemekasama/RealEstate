# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Built from Scratch, vite, installed dependencies.

Project Setup; made a folder for each section, with two files imbedded, a jsx and css file

Pure Css Skills; created custom css classes, so i don't repeat myself over and over again

Responsive Design; project is responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens

States and hooks in React

Carousel by Swiper Js; first time using this, was complicated at first but I figured it out

Framer Motion for animation; First time using Framer motion for a project, will try to use it even for my old projects.
